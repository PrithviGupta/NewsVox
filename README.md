# Alan AI news reader app ðŸ“°
This is a news app that can be controlled by voice commands through a virtual assistant AlanAI.  
* By using simple voice commands such as "Give me the latest news," "What's up with Bitcoin," or "Tell me the latest news from CNN," the user can get the desired news articles.  
* There are numerous other commands that can be given to Alan to fetch the required results. Additionally, the app allows Alan to read out headlines and open articles by saying "Open 5" to open the fifth article on the page.  
* Moreover, the user can engage in small talk with Alan by asking general questions regarding his age or name to check his response. You can find the link to the app in the About section.
