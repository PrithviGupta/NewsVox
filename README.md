The app is designed to fetch news using voice commands, allowing the user to request the latest news, news by category, term, or source. It utilizes the News API to fetch and display news articles.  
Additionally, the user can instruct the app to read the headlines and open articles to read and return to the main page. As the headlines are read, the app automatically scrolls down the page.  
The app's user interface is built using React and Material UI, while Alan AI and Alan Studio are used to add voice capabilities to the app.  
The libraries words-to-numbers and classnames are also utilized. The app is deployed on Netlify.
